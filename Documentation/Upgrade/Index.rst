Deprecations


Confirmation links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New TypoScript options are added for this:
new.email.createUserConfirmation.confirmUserConfirmation
When enabled, a user confirming their profile creation via the email link will show a confirmation dialog beforehand. This prevents unexpected execution f.e. via Virus Scanners
new.email.createUserConfirmation.confirmAdminConfirmation
When enabled, an admin confirming/refusing/silently refusing someones profile creation via the email link will show a confirmation dialog beforehand
This PR also includes adjustments to HashUtility allowing to specify more data while hashing a user, so that another hash can be created to prevent meddling with the admin actions (which by default is already prevented using cHashes).

For new.email.createUserConfirmation.confirmAdminConfirmation, this technically is a breaking change as template
adjustments were required to pass the admin hash to the email links. If you have customized templates, please add the
variable "adminHash:adminHash" to all action links in Resources/Private/Templates/Email/CreateAdminConfirmation.html

Example:
old:		<f:link.action action="confirmCreateRequest" controller="New" absolute="1" arguments="{user:user, hash:hash, status:'adminConfirmation'}">
new		<f:link.action action="confirmCreateRequest" controller="New" absolute="1" arguments="{user:user, hash:hash, adminHash:adminHash, status:'adminConfirmation'}">

These settings are getting the default settings for V14! This change applies also for V13!

Upgrade Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Plugins used in your pages **must** be updated.
The Updater is located in :guilabel:`Admin Tools > Upgrade > Run Upgrade Wizard > "EXT:femanager: Migrate plugins"`

TypoScript Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use the uploading feature for avatar images, the configuration has to be changed to the combined identifier

**Constants:**

.. code-block:: typoscript

   plugin.tx_femanager {
      settings {
         uploadFolder = 1:users/
      }
   }

DataProcessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DataProcessors configured under plugin.tx_femanager.settings.dataProcessors are now without a return value, if you need to change data in the request use PSR-15 Middlewares

Autologin
~~~~~~~~~

Currently the AutoLogin feature does not work. When we have found a solution the feature will be enabled again, until then a link to the login page could be inserted.

.. _v7.1:

to version 7.1.0
----------------

**Invitation Template**

If you are using customized templates for the invitation function, please check the Resources/Private/Templates/Invitation/Edit.html

You need to add

.. code-block:: html

   <f:form.hidden name="hash" value="{hash}"/>

in order,that the function is working.


.. _v6.0:

to version 6.0.0
----------------

Version 6.0 support TYPO3 9 LTS and 10 LTS. The support for TYPO3 8 was dropped. No changes on Templates are needed.

**Backend Module "Frontend User" - View User Confirmation**

If you want to use the Backend Module to confirm or refuse Frontend User, you need to setup the configPID. The extension
uses now a frontend call out of the backend, to organise these actions.

.. code-block:: typoscript

    module.tx_femanager {
        settings {
            configPID = 1
        }
    }


.. _v5.2:

to version 5.2.0
----------------

The edit template has to be adjusted, as there is a new parameter 'token' is introduced.

Please update these partials:

:file:`/Partials/Misc/DeleteLink.html`

The argument token was introduced.

**old:**

.. code-block:: html

      <f:link.action
         action="delete"
         arguments="{user:user}"
         class="btn btn-warning btn-large"
         additionalAttributes="{data-confirm:'{f:translate(key:\'UserDeleteConfirmation\')}'}">
         <i class="icon-trash icon-white"></i>
         <f:translate key="deleteProfile" />
      </f:link.action>

**new:**

.. code-block:: html

      <f:link.action
         action="delete"
         arguments="{user:user, token:token}"
         class="btn btn-warning btn-large"
         additionalAttributes="{data-confirm:'{f:translate(key:\'UserDeleteConfirmation\')}'}">
         <i class="icon-trash icon-white"></i>
         <f:translate key="deleteProfile" />
      </f:link.action>

:file:`/Templates/Edit/Edit.html`

You need to add: :html:`<f:form.hidden name="token" value="{token}" />` between the form tag.

Example:

.. code-block:: html

	<f:form
		name="user"
		object="{user}"
		action="update"
		enctype="multipart/form-data"
		additionalAttributes="{data-femanager-plugin:data.uid}"
		class="form-horizontal {f:if(condition:'{settings.edit.validation._enable.client}',then:'feManagerValidation',else:'')}">
	<fieldset>
		<legend>
			<f:translate key="titleUpdateProfile" />
		</legend>

		<f:form.hidden name="token" value="{token}" />

		more stuff here in the template fileâ€¦

	</f:form>

.. _v5.0:

to version 5
------------

There are minor breaking changes include. Main change is, that all eid scripts were replace, by a page num approach.

In order that the js validation works, you need to take care, that you these page typenums are available:


1. Backend Module: Login as User feature

::

    feManagerLoginAs.typeNum = 1548943013

see the complete config in file ext_typoscript_setup.txt

2. Frontend Validation via JS

::

    feManagerLoginAs.typeNum = 1548935210

see the complete config in file Configuration/TypoScript/setup.ext

.. _v4.0:

to version 4.2.3 / 4.2.4 / 4.2.5
--------------------------------

If you use your own HTML templates of new/edit/invitation-templates you should compare them with the one from
EXT:femanager. There is a new additional attribute inside the form viewhelper: data-femanager-plugin, which contains
the content element id.

If you use a modified version of the Validation.js, there are also changes: plugin and action parameter is send to
the eID-Script now
